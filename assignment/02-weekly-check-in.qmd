Answer these questions and submit your responses on iCollege.

I *highly recommend* writing your responses in a separate document and copying/pasting the text into iCollege. It will be far easier for you if you write the responses right after completing the readings and watching the videos instead of waiting until you get around to putting them in iCollegeâ€”**you will forget your questions and insights if you don't.**
