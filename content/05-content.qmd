## Other useful resources

I pause a couple times during the lecture sections on indifference curves and utility maximization and I mention that you should watch these videos. Here are those videos:

- <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> [Marginal Revolution University, "Indifference curves"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmDo5jLFw8) (watch during the "Utility and indifference" section)
- <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> [Marginal Revolution University, "Constraint optimization"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXIgp-P-FeY) (watch during the "Maximizing utility" section)

Also, a complete walkthrough of how to maximize utility with algebra and graphs is at the ["Utility maximization" guide](/resource/indifference-budget.qmd) in the resources section.
