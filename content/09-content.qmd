[^paperclips]: **WARNING**: This game can take over your life for the next day or so, which can be really fun and rewarding, but also *it can seriously for real consume every waking moment* for a few hours. This is your official warning.


## Other useful resources

These two sessions have a bunch of helpful guides in the resources section:

- [Firm costs + profit maximization](/resource/costs/)
- [Supply, demand, surplus, DWL, and elasticity](/resource/supply-demand/)
- [Monopolies](/resource/monopoly/)

You should definitely check those guides out and follow along with the examples there. 

These topics are covered in pretty much every introductory economics class in the world, which means the internet is full of examples of how to do the math involved. I've included lists of helpful videos at the top of each of these guides.
