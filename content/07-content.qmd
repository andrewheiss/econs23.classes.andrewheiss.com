## Other useful resources

A full example of finding income and substitution effects graphically is at the ["Income and substitution effects" guide](/resource/income-substitution/) in the resources section.

Here are some other examples of finding income and substitution effects:

- [Example Income and Substitution Effects for Normal and Inferior Goods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLhh_D5b_Lg)
- [Explanation of Income and Substitution Effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysqGRwvlte0)
- [EC1002 Chapter 2 Lesson 2 - The Indifference Curve, Substitution, and Income Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDniSzSmpbU) (this one is long and detailed, but still helpful, especially around minute 21)
