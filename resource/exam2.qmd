## Firms and markets

**You should understand…**

- …how demand curves are derived from consumer willingness to pay
- …the difference between fixed costs and variable costs
- …how to calculate total cost, total revenue, average fixed costs, average variable costs, marginal cost, marginal revenue, and maximum profit
- …that maximum profit occurs where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost ($MR = MC$)
- …that socially optimal quantity occurs when the demand is equal to the marginal cost ($\text{demand} = MC$)
- …how to calculate elasticity of demand ($-\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}$)
- …what elasticity measures and why it is important in public policy and administration
- …how a single demand curve can have an overall elasticity *and* different elasticities at each point
- …economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, economies of agglomeration, network effects, and the difference between short-run and long-run costs
- …that market equilibria (i.e. optimal price and quantity) occur at the intersection of supply and demand curves
- …how government-imposed price floors and price ceilings distort market-clearing equilibria 
- …and be able to identify the differences between changes in supply/demand and changes in quantity supplied/demanded
- …what consumer and producer surplus represent
- …the relationship between elasticity of supply and/or demand and the size of consumer and producer surplus
- …how taxes impose deadweight loss on society
- …how the burden of taxes depends on the elasticity of supply and/or demand
- …why governments tax and the philosophical and ethical principles behind who should bear the burden of taxes
- …the difference between price-taking and price-making
- …how firms try to gain market power, including monopolies, branding, cost controls, regulation, and switching costs
- …why firms try to gain market power
- …why firms want to price discriminate
- …the consequences of monopolistic production (lower Q and higher P than what would happen under perfect competition; deadweight loss)
- …how governments can regulate monopolies
- …why natural monopolies exist and how governments can induce them to produce at socially optimal levels
- …how firms need to be somewhat anti-competitive and anti-capitalist in order to maximize profits, innovate, and (essentially) be more competitive and capitalist

**Important formulas:**

- Demand:

    $$
    P = aQ + b
    $$

- Total cost:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    TC = TFC + TVC \\\\
    \text{or a formula using } Q \text{, like} \\\\
    TC = aQ^2 + b
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- Average cost:

    $$
    AC = \frac{TC}{Q}
    $$

- Marginal cost:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    MC &= \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q} \\\\
    &\text{or} \\\\
    MC &= \text{First derivative of TC} \\\\
    &= 2aQ \text{ (if } TC = aQ^2 + b)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- Total revenue:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    TR &= PQ \\\\
    &\text{or} \\\\
    TR &= (aQ + b)Q \\\\
    &= aQ^2 + bQ
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- Average revenue:

    $$
    AR = \frac{TR}{Q}
    $$

- Marginal revenue:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    MR &= \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q} \\\\
    &\text{or} \\\\
    MR &= \text{First derivative of TR} \\\\
    &= 2aQ + b \text{ (if } TR = aQ^2 + bQ)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- Maximum profit:

    $$
    max(\pi): MC = MR
    $$

- Price elasticity of demand ([see this guide](/resource/costs/#elasticity-of-demand/) of how to get to $- \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}$):

    $$
    \varepsilon = -\frac{\\\% \text{ change in quantity demand}}{\\\% \text{ change in price}} = - \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}
    $$

**Important graphs:**

- Consumer surplus, producer surplus, tax revenues, tax burdens, and deadweight loss (use algebra and geometry to figure out the areas of the triangles ($\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$) and rectangles ($l \times w$)):

```{r supply-demand-surplus, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, indent="    "}
library(tidyverse)
source(here::here("R", "graphics.R"))
source(here::here("R", "supply-demand-surplus.R"))

tax_graph(demand, supply, supply_tax, NULL, TRUE)$plot
```

## Institutions, power, and inequality

**You should understand…**

- …why institutions matter for public administration, policy, and governance
- …the strengths and weaknesses of and the and general differences between three main theoretical approaches to institutions: institutions as rational behavior, institutions as constraints, and institutions as temporary equilibria
- …the difference between informal and formal institutions
- …why informal institutions exert influence over our actions even if they're not officially codified
- …the difference between self-enforcing, self-reinforcing, and self-undermining institutions
- …the role of path dependency in the emergence of institutions

&nbsp;

## Market and government failures

**You should understand…**

- …the difference between private goods, club goods, common pool resources, and public goods (and how they can be classified as (non)rivalrous and (non)excludable)
- …what a market failure is
- …what a government failure is
- …what public goods are and how governments, the private sector, and informal institutions can address them
- …what common pool resources (CPRs) are and how governments, the private sector, and informal institutions can address them
- …the difference between social and private marginal cost (supply) and marginal benefit (demand)
- …what externalities are and how governments, the private sector, and informal institutions can address them
- …what Coasian bargaining is, when it is advantageous, and why it sometimes fails
- …how cap and trade systems can fix externalities (and when they can't)
- …how Pigouvian taxes can fix externalities (and when they can't)
- …how regulation can fix externalities (and when and why it can't)
- …the difference between income and assets
- …why shared national identity and strong horizontal networks of institutions are important for a country's social and economic wellbeing
- …how inequitable public policies lead to decreased public goods provision, unequal institutional access, and increased ethnofractionalization
- …why slavery and white supremacy have had lasting institutional impacts on the economic system of today and how government policies have contributed to these consequences (specifically in housing and education)
